          %p
            %strong Bloody useful.
            %a{:href => "https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aejoelaoggembcahagimdiliamlcdmfm"} Dev HTTP Client
            is a Google Chrome extension to
            %em "[e]asily construct custom HTTP requests, save them permanently, take advantage of variables and contexts."
            Comes with lots of neat features such as response syntax highlighting (HTML/XML/JSON) and image previews.
          %p
            %strong Calepin is closing shop.
            The blogging service I use for this here blog is called
            %a{:href => "http://calepin.co/"} Calepin,
            and I like it a lot (as
            %a{:href => "http://carlo.zottmann.org/2012/01/20/the-big-blog-move-of-2012/"} mentioned before
            ).
            Unfortunately, Jökull can no longer maintain it and so decided
            %a{:href => "http://twitter.com/calepinapp/status/192335906479415296"} to close shop in June.
            He
            %a{:href => "http://github.com/jokull/calepin"} open-sourced the project,
            tho.  If anyone wants to pick it up…
          %p
            Being no stranger to the blogging game, I know all of my options, but I gotta say, Calepin's concept (single files in Dropbox + push-button publishing via the website) really appealed to me more than the everything-in-Github-and-publish-via-Terminal way.  I'd switch to Calepin-contender
            %a{:href => "http://scriptogr.am/"} Scriptogram
            in an instant if they would allow for more flexibility in their blogs' URL paths.
          %p
            %strong Better not use the word "book" there, pal.
            In the name of your new project, and if you're a Facebook user, that is.  As
            %a{:href => "http://j.mp/I0Skpr"} Ars reported a month ago,
            if you're a FB user, you've agreed on a legally binding contract that prevents you from using several words in your own, non-FB projects.  Nice to see they're staying in character.
          %p
            %strong Fukken shoelaces, how do they work?
            There's more than one way to tie a knot.  I own some shoelaces that come undone rather easily (due to their teflon-like surface material), but tying them using the
            %a{:href => "http://www.fieggen.com/shoelace/ianknot.htm"} Ian Knot
            helps.
          %p
            %strong Hardcore l33t farming.
            Today's extreme e-sports video (spoof) is delightful.
