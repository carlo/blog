I am one of the "if you want to do it, do it right" school. I try to make it
apply to everything. This is the reason why I am kind of ticked off when I
hear people say things like _"Oh my Gosh!"_ or _"Jeeebus!"_. Anyways, this
"conversation" occured two minutes ago in our office:

> A (female): "Fudge!"
>
> me: "The word is 'fuck', not 'fudge'. Curse properly, woman."
>
> A: "Fudge."
>
> me: "Fuck."
>
> A: "Fudge!"
>
> me: "Fuck!"
>
> A: "Guys, is it 'fudge' or 'fuck'? Hey, M, 'fudge' or 'fuck'?"
>
> M: "Is that an offer?"

At this point everyone burst into laughter. I love this place.
