It happens.

I see no point in running [Planet Yahoo!][1] anymore, for reasons probably
known â€” i.e. a few months ago Yahoo!'s decided [my services as an engineer
(and those of my co-workers)][2] were no longer required.

Sorry if you were one of the few people finding some value in the aggregation
of all these Yahoo! blogs into one big feed.
