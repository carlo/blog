We went out to watch [Mr. & Mrs. Smith][1] last night. Despite the mediocre
reviews the flick is receiving, I have to say, it was a two-hour fun ride for
me. Pitt and Jolie seemed to have fun in their roles, and it showed. It was a
thoroughly enjoyable romantic assassination comedy.

Recommended if you're looking for silly, funny, romantic and not-overly-deep
summer movie.
